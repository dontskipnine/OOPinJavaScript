OOPinJavaScript
Will feature examples of OOP in JavaScript. This means both Pre-ES6 && Post-ES6 work.
Understanding how OOP applies to JavaScript has been a journey for me as I originally
learned it in C#. I've been extending my knowledge on FreeCodeCamp, but the OOP
section simply left me with more questions than answers so I went off on my own
and found some material. One of those is a series of articles by @WellPaidGeek.

This is me working through various materials to understand it. If it helps you too, yay!

Happy coding!
